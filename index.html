                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Bria Tran. I’m a data analyst and aspiring data scientist who dreams of helping music professionals and creative industries use data and technology to uncover insights, understand audiences, and design more meaningful, human-centered experiences.<br></br>
                    My core skills include SQL, Python, Excel, data visualization, systems design, full-stack development, and UI/UX design. I’m also actively exploring machine learning and AI-driven technologies as part of my ongoing learning journey. <br></br>
                    Beyond the technical side, I care deeply about collaboration, problem-solving, and creating positive, creative environments where ideas can grow. Years of working in diverse roles have shaped my ability to lead with empathy, communicate clearly, and build solutions that bring real value to people. <br></br>
                    The projects below reflect both my technical skills and my passion for using technology to connect people, amplify creativity, and drive innovation, especially in spaces like music where art and community come together. <br></br>
                    If you'd like to learn more about who I am, and whether I'd be a great fit for your team or project, feel free to explore my "Learn More About Me" section!

                    At the core of my work is one question: How can we listen to people better, through music and data?<br></br>
                    That question drives both my academic path and creative pursuits. I’ve built a strong foundation in SQL, Python, data visualization,
                    and systems design, and I’m now diving deeper into machine learning and AI-driven projects to explore how emerging technologies can
                    push the boundaries of music and art, while staying rooted in the humanity of these forms. In a world where technology is evolving rapidly,
                    I believe it’s equally important to keep learning about the world around us, cultures, communities, and where tech can serve to bring people
                    together in new and meaningful ways.

                    I’m a second-generation Vietnamese American and the oldest of 13 cousins, a role that has deeply shaped how I navigate the world.
                    Growing up in this position taught me to be highly organized, responsible, and reliable, with a natural focus on care, leadership,
                    and helping others thrive, values that guide both my personal and professional life.<br></br>
                    In every space I enter, whether on a project team, in the workplace, or in my personal life, I intentionally strive to create environments
                    that are collaborative, supportive, and solution-oriented. I believe that fostering positive team dynamics, encouraging fast and creative problem-solving,
                    and building strong relationships are essential to achieving meaningful outcomes. I care deeply about helping people feel valued, heard, and empowered to
                    contribute their best ideas.

                    For me, innovation and creativity thrive when people feel safe to take risks, experiment, and learn together. That’s why I prioritize cultivating
                    environments where curiosity, open dialogue, and cross-disciplinary thinking are not only welcomed, but celebrated. Whether through music, technology,
                    or leadership, I view bringing people together, across cultures, backgrounds, and perspectives, as one of the most important contributions I can make.<br></br>
                    Though still early in my career, I’ve gained a wide range of skills by working diverse jobs from a young age, sharpening my teamwork, leadership, problem-solving,
                    and operations abilities. These experiences taught me how to adapt quickly and consistently seek ways to support my teams and contribute to positive,
                    people-centered spaces.

                    In addition to my technical work, I’m also a passionate DJ, music producer, and community builder. I love creating spaces where people can encounter
                    new sounds and experiences, not just as entertainment, but as moments of shared connection and belonging.<br></br>
                    As the music world increasingly embraces AI and big data, I aspire to contribute to projects that honor tradition, empower artists, and amplify diverse
                    voices, ensuring we use technology to enrich creativity while keeping its human heart intact. For me, the future of music is not just entertainment, it’s
                    a reflection of who we are, where we’ve been, and where we’re going, and I’m excited to help shape that future through thoughtful, collaborative,
                    and human-centered innovation.
