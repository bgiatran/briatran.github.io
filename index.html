                <p> Hello! My name is Bria Tran. I’m a data analyst and aspiring data scientist who dreams of helping music professionals and creative industries use data and technology to 
                    help the music and creative industries thrive. My core skills include SQL, Python, Excel, data visualization, and systems design. I’m also actively exploring machine learning and AI-driven technologies as part of my ongoing learning journey.<br></br>
                    In addition to data, I’m very interested in project management and product strategy, particularly in building better systems that support artist recognition, music discovery, 
                    and global cultural appreciation. I aim to develop processes that not only streamline our engagement with music but also help underrepresented artists gain visibility and connect 
                    with audiences who truly value their work.<br></br>
                    On the side, I work on small projects to keep growing my skills and apply what I learn in real ways. The projects you’ll see here reflect my technical abilities and my passion for 
                    using technology to empower artists and enrich creative communities. If you want to know more about me or think I’d be a great fit for your team or project, feel free to explore my “More” section!

                <p>
                    At the heart of everything I do is one guiding question: How can we listen to people better, through music, data, and technology?<br></br>
                    That question fuels both my academic journey and my creative pursuits. I’ve built a solid foundation in SQL, Python, data visualization, 
                    and systems design, and I’m currently diving deeper into machine learning and AI-driven projects to explore how emerging technologies 
                    can push the boundaries of music and creativity, while staying rooted in the humanity behind them.<br></br>
                    In today’s fast-moving tech landscape, I believe it's just as important to stay curious about the world around us, its communities, histories, 
                    and lived experiences. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I’m especially interested in how data can be used not just to optimize performance, but to tell stories, uncover talent, 
                    and create more inclusive experiences. Some of the real-world problems I’m passionate about solving include:<br></br>
                    • Helping music labels spot rising talent early through predictive analytics<br>
                    • Improving music recommendation systems for diverse and global audiences<br>
                    • Designing tools that support localized, culturally relevant content distribution<br></br>
                    As a second-generation Vietnamese American and the eldest of 13 cousins, I’ve learned to lead with empathy, stay adaptable, and show up for the 
                    people around me, whether that's on a team, in my creative community, or within my family. These values deeply influence how I approach collaboration, 
                    communication, and systems thinking.

                    While I’m grounded in technical work, I’ve developed a strong interest in product strategy and project management. Especially the challenge of turning big, creative 
                    ideas into scalable, real-world systems. I’m energized by opportunities to connect vision with execution, like streamlining workflows, aligning cross-functional 
                    teams, and designing experiments that lead to better decisions and better outcomes.<br></br>
                    Though still early in my career, I’ve had the chance to grow through a range of roles that sharpened my adaptability, collaboration, and communication skills.
                    Outside of tech, I’m also a musician, DJ, and event curator, creating spaces where people come together around sound! My love for 
                    Traditional music across cultures has introduced me to incredible communities around the world, teaching me more about people than any textbook ever could.

                    As AI, data systems, and emerging technologies continue to transform the creative industries, I want to help build tools that are not only cutting-edge but also equitable, 
                    culturally aware and human-centered. I’m especially passionate about ensuring that the traditional and cultural roots of music and art aren’t lost in this rapid digital 
                    evolution. Technology should serve as a bridge. To make creativity more accessible, discoverable, and connected, all while honoring the rich histories behind it.<br></br>
                    Through thoughtful systems design and data-driven innovation, we have the opportunity to expand who gets to create, be seen, and be heard across geographies, cultures, 
                    and languages. Music is a reflection of who we are, where we’ve been, and where we’re going, and I’d love to be part of a team building toward that future, together.
