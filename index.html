                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Bria Tran. I’m a data analyst and aspiring data scientist who dreams of helping music professionals and creative industries use data and technology to uncover insights, understand audiences, and design more meaningful, human-centered experiences.<br></br>
                    My core skills include SQL, Python, Excel, data visualization, systems thinking, and full-stack development. I’m also actively exploring machine learning and AI-driven technologies as part of my ongoing learning journey.<br></br>
                    In addition to data, I’m deeply interested in project management and product strategy, particularly in building better systems that support artist recognition, music discovery, and global cultural appreciation. I aim to develop processes that not only streamline our engagement with music but also help underrepresented artists gain visibility and connect with audiences who truly value their work.<br></br>
                    What drives me is the belief that music and technology together can tell powerful stories, bridge cultural gaps, and create real change. I care about collaboration, problem-solving, and creating positive, creative environments where ideas can grow. My experience across different roles has shaped my ability to lead with empathy, communicate clearly, and contribute to solutions that elevate both people and purpose.<br></br>
                    The projects below reflect my technical foundation and my passion for using technology to empower artists, amplify culture, and build tools that make a difference in the creative world. If you'd like to learn more about who I am and whether I’d be a great fit for your team or project, feel free to explore my “More” section!

                <p>
                    At the core of my work is one question: How can we listen to people better, through music and data?<br></br>
                    That question drives both my academic path and creative pursuits. I’ve built a strong foundation in SQL, Python, 
                    data visualization, and systems design, and I’m now diving deeper into machine learning and AI-driven projects to explore 
                    how emerging technologies can push the boundaries of music and art, while staying rooted in the humanity behind them.

            <div class="more-about-text">
                <p>
                    In a world where technology evolves rapidly, I believe it’s just as important to keep learning about the world around us, cultures, communities, 
                    and the people we’re building for. I care about how we use data not just to optimize outcomes, but to tell stories, uncover talent, and expand 
                    what’s possible. I’m especially passionate about using data to support real-world industry goals like helping labels identify rising artists 
                    earlier, improving music discovery and recommendation systems, and building tools that bring localized, culturally relevant content to audiences 
                    around the world.<br></br>
                    I’m a second-generation Vietnamese American and the oldest of 13 cousins, a role that’s shaped how I move through the world. It’s taught me to 
                    lead with empathy, stay organized, and support the people around me: whether that’s in my family, on a project team, or in my broader creative community.

                <p>
                    While I’m grounded in technical work, I’ve developed a growing interest in product strategy and project management. The work of taking big ideas and building the 
                    processes that make them real. I’m energized by opportunities to connect vision with execution: whether that means streamlining workflows, aligning cross-functional 
                    teams, or designing experiments that lead to better decisions and better outcomes.<br></br>
                    Though still early in my career, I’ve had the chance to grow through a range of roles that sharpened my adaptability, collaboration, and communication skills.
                    I’ve also pursued my love for music outside of tech, as a musician, DJ, and event curator, creating spaces where people can come together and connect over sound, 
                    emotion, and shared experience.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As AI and big data continue to shape the music industry, I want to help build systems that are not only innovative, but equitable, artist-first, and globally 
                    conscious. I’m excited by projects that honor creative traditions, uplift underrepresented voices, and bring communities closer through thoughtful, culturally 
                    aware technology.<br></br>
                    For me, the future of music isn’t just about what we listen to. It’s about how we listen, who we choose to amplify, and why it all matters. Music is a reflection 
                    of who we are, where we’ve been, and where we’re going. And I’d love to be part of a team that’s working to shape that future, together.
