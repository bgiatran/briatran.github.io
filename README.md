# About Me

Hello there! My name is Bria Tran and I am a second-year IS student at Seattle Pacific University.

Besides academic subjects, I love playing instruments and listening to music!
My main instruments are the bass and alto saxophone, but I enjoy many others. I also have a band with four other girls I met at a concert and we've been playing together for about three months.
As for music genres, I love them all. However, my favorite genres are R&B, jazz, and afrobeats. My most notable hobbies are certainly DJing and dancing with my friends.

### AdoraPlan: An Adoration Schduler

These documents outline the design and architecture of the Adoration Scheduler App, AdoraPlan. This app is a solution developed to facilitate the coordination of Eucharistic veneration time slots within the St. Pius X Parish Community and potentially across the Archdiocese of Seattle. The app aims to streamline the aign-u[ process, manage adoration slots, address parishioners' challenges, and enhance their spiritual experience.
