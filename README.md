# About Me

Hello there! My name is Bria Tran and I am a first-year information systems student minoring in data analytics at Seattle Pacific University. 
I might be switching my major to Biochemistry and minoring in Computer Science, but I am still figuring out what I want to do. I want to work in BioTech and advance medical technology though. 
Additionally, I have always dreamed of working on nuclear and chemical weapons, so I am hoping to work with the military someday!

Besides academic subjects, I love playing instruments and listening to music! If I were a nepotism baby, I would have pursued a career in the arts, but here I am.
My main instruments are the bass and alto saxophone, but I enjoy many others. I also have a band with four other girls I met at a concert and we've been playing together for about three months.
As for music genres, I love them all. However, my favorite genres are R&B, jazz, and afrobeats. My most notable hobbies are certainly DJing and dancing with my friends.
